# ClubStack
The ClubStack Mobile Application for iOS and Android is be *the* place to host University Clubs and Organizations. it allows users to sign up under a specific school with a username and password. After signing in, they are able to see a "stack" of all the clubs at their university. The "ClubStack" shows the first photo posted by the club, as well as the club's name. The User can then touch the club and view a preview of the club that shows some images, events, as well as the president's contact information.

##Joining Clubs
In order to join a club, the user must get into contact with someone who is already in the club. Each club has a unique QR Code tied to it, which can be used to join the club in the ClubStack. The user scans the QR code using the scanner provided in the club preview, and is then admitted into the club. Any further clicks on this specific club will bring them to the Club's screen that shows all photos, events, and other members' names and emails.
